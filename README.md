ðŸ‘‹ Hey, Iâ€™m Raed Rahman

An University of Waterloo Systems Design Engineering Student 

Seeking Winter 2024-2025 Co-op opportunities in SWE, QA, & PM.

Experienced in SWE, QA, and PM, with multiple internships, like at ZeuZ Automation Solutionz, where I automated 100+ test scripts for Android and web apps. Iâ€™ve led teams of 450+ in organizing 10+ events, raising $13K for school initiatives, and worked internationally as a tutor. My entrepreneurial spirit shines through projects like Mergency, where I surveyed 300+ students, conducted market research, and projected $750K in revenue over the next decade. I've consistently ranked in the 95th percentile in competitions and earned over $75K in scholarships.
Iâ€™m excited to leverage the University of Waterloo's experiential learning to combine my agile development skills with leadership experience for future co-op opportunities. Letâ€™s chat about Engineering, Finance, Tech, or Product â€” feel free to DM me!
